    <p>Pictured here is my server that this website and my other selfhosted services are running off of. This particular hardware was handed down to me, and has a Intel I7-6700K, 16 GB DDR4 memory, and 2 Nvidia Quadro K620 graphics cards. This is far more than enough compute power for the foressable future for me and my server needs.
    <br>
    I have been doing selfhosting projects since I was in FRC in 2020, but I have only really had my own server since 2022. Before the current server I was using a Lenovo ThinkStation tiny pc with a Intel I5 VPRO that was doubling as a home theater PC for my parents. That server still exists as a backup to my main and ensures that there is some level of redundancy for my dynamic dns service that I rely on to maintain a remote connection.
    <br>
    The new server is currently running Proxmox VE that provides 3 LXCs for my primary services. The old server is currently running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
    <br>
    I do plan on upgrading the RAM in the new server as that has become a limiting factor somewhat recently as I added another game server to my stack that started to cause some issues due to a lack of memory.</p>
